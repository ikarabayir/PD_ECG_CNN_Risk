# Getting Started
1. The python versions and libraries you have should meet above.
2. Get the code $ git clone the repo and install the dependencies
3. For 10 year predicted risk scores and labels, execute below in the local repo directory,

python Github-ECG-AI_PD_Risk_Prediction.py sample_ECG.npy

The py file would provide risk scores and labels to your local directory as csv files.
